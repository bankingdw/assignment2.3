 component of Hadoop 1.x

NameNode
• Contains the Hadoop FileSystem Tree and other metadata information about files and
directories
• Contains in-memory mapping of which blocks are stored in which datanode

Secondary Namenode
• Performs house-keeping activities for NameNode, like periodic merging of namespace and
edits
• This is not a back up for NameNode

DataNode
• Stores actual data blocks of file in HDFS on its own local disk
• Sends signals to NameNode periodically (called as Heartbeat) to verify if it is active
• Sends block reporting to the NameNode on cluster startup as well as periodically at
every 10th Heartbeat
• The DataNode are the workhorse of the system
• They perform all the block operations, including periodic the Checksum. They receive
instructions from the NameNode of where to put the blocks and how to put the blocks

JobTracker (Not present in Hadoop 2.x)
• Controls overall execution of map reduce jobs

TaskTracker (Not present in Hadoop 2.x)
• Runs individual map-reduce jobs on DataNodes
• Periodically communicates with the JobTracker to give updates and receive instructions
